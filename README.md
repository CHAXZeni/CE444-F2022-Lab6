## Pros and Cons of TDD
Pros:  
While utilizing TDD you are writing unit-tests for the features before they are developed, then creating the features with the unit-test in mind. This results in a final codebase that is more modular in design as it built up one feature at a time. In addition, overtime the modularity makes the codebase easier to maintain and there is a high-test coverage which makes debugging code easier. Finally, TDD means a programmer needs to understand their codeâ€™s inputs, outputs, and requirements to right proper unit-tests.  
Cons:  
The biggest con of TDD is that it that it initially slows down the development process. Implementation code cannot be written until tests code is written; when starting with a blank slate this can mean a lot more time before a working product is reached. Furthermore, it can be a lot of work to maintain tests as the codebase is updated and changed.
